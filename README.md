# Console2048-Linux
a simple console 2048 game I made in under one day.

# How to play
clone or download the source of the repository

if you have **g++**, then open your **command prompt**, type in `g++ -o main main.cpp` to **compile** the cpp file for running purposes, then type in `./main` to run it.

if you happen to also have **make** installed, then simply typing `make` will do the job for you (including compiling and running using **g++**)

**Do note**: if the map is smaller than what you prefer, you can choose to go into the source code, then modify `m_X` and `m_Y` to change the map size, default is **4 x 4**.

# Controls
wasd (case insensitive) to push the numbers
q to quit (it will prompt you and ask you to type in either the letter y(as in yes) or n(as in no) to confirm)
